This is a bit of an unnecessary document, but I thought I'd share it anyways.

<.docx checking>
I had a lot of trouble installing python-docx, so much that I couldn't
even get it in the end. So, that feature went out the window as I can't
scan .docx without it.

<A Fourth Setting>
I was planning to have a fourth setting in addition to phone numbers,
times, and four-digit codes. It may have been a certain string,
like a first and last name.

<Condensed Regexes>
I originally only wanted to have one form for the phone checker, and it should have
found all of them, but I couldn't get it to work.
