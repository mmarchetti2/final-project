# Instructions for Running File Scanner:
1. Open and run fileScanner.py through IDLE (Python35 32-bit).
2. Type in 1, 2, or 3 to choose what pattern you want to scan for in a document.
3. After selecting that, type in the file name (It has to be in the same directory as the program)
4. Then, it will ask you what the file type is. Choose accordingly. (I only have pdf and txt files so far)
5. Watch it go. If you chose phone numbers, it will return 4 phone number forms: XXX-XXX-XXXX, +1XXXXXXXXXX,
XXXXXXXXXX, and (XXX) XXX-XXXX. If you chose codes, it will return the codes it found, and the same goes for the times.

Also, you're going to need to install PyPDF2 if you haven't already. Type in cmd on your seach bar, then enter 
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Scripts\pip install PyPDF2
(Make sure to replace USERNAME with your computer username)
